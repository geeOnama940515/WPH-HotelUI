   - Room selection interface with visual cards
   - Comprehensive form validation and cost breakdown

5. **Contact Page (`/contact`)**:
   - Contact information and inquiry form
   - FAQ section and location details
   - Form submission with success feedback

#### Admin/Authenticated Pages:
6. **Authentication Page (`/auth`)**:
   - Admin login with demo credentials
   - Secure authentication flow

7. **Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)**:
   - Comprehensive analytics with KPIs
   - Multi-tab interface (Dashboard, Bookings, Rooms)
   - Real-time data visualization and management tools

8. **My Bookings Page (`/my-bookings`)**:
   - User booking history and management
   - Status tracking and booking details

### Design Principles:
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints for all screen sizes
- **Consistent UI/UX**: Unified design language across all pages
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex information revealed contextually
- **Accessibility**: Proper semantic HTML and keyboard navigation support

## 3. Navigation Implementation

### Client-Side Routing with React Router DOM:
```javascript
// Route Configuration
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  <Route path="/rooms" element={<Rooms />} />
  <Route path="/room-details/:id" element={<RoomDetails />} />
  <Route path="/booking" element={<Booking />} />
  <Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />
  <Route path="/auth" element={<Auth />} />
  <Route path="/admin" element={<Admin />} />
  <Route path="/my-bookings" element={<MyBookings />} />
</Routes>
```

### Navigation Features:
- **Header Navigation**: Persistent navigation bar with responsive mobile menu
- **Contextual Navigation**: Back buttons and breadcrumbs where appropriate
- **State Preservation**: Navigation maintains application state
- **Deep Linking**: Direct URL access to any page with proper routing
- **Protected Routes**: Admin pages require authentication

### Navigation UX Enhancements:
- **Active State Indicators**: Visual feedback for current page
- **Smooth Transitions**: CSS transitions between page changes
- **Mobile Optimization**: Hamburger menu for mobile devices
- **Call-to-Action Prominence**: Distinct "Book Now" button styling

## 4. Error Handling and Feedback

### Comprehensive Error Handling Strategy:

#### Form Validation:
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on form inputs
- **Comprehensive Checks**: Email format, required fields, capacity limits
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear, actionable error descriptions
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded feedback (red for errors, green for success)

#### API Error Handling:
```javascript
// Example from authService.js
try {
  const response = await api.post('/auth/login', { email, password });
  return response.user;
} catch (error) {
  throw new Error(error.message || 'Login failed');
}
```

#### User Feedback Systems:
- **Loading States**: Visual indicators during async operations
- **Success Confirmations**: Clear success messages for completed actions
- **Error Recovery**: Guidance on how to resolve issues
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback content when data is unavailable

#### Specific Error Handling Examples:
1. **Booking Form**: Validates guest capacity against room limits
2. **Room Details**: Handles missing room data with user-friendly messages
3. **Authentication**: Clear feedback for invalid credentials
4. **Image Loading**: Fallback handling for missing images

## 5. Client-Side Routing Implementation

### React Router DOM Integration:
- **BrowserRouter**: HTML5 history API for clean URLs
- **Route Parameters**: Dynamic routing for room details (`/room-details/:id`)
- **Query Parameters**: Room selection via URL parameters
- **Programmatic Navigation**: `useNavigate` hook for form submissions
- **Route Guards**: Authentication checks for protected routes

### Routing Features:
- **Nested Routing**: Admin dashboard with sub-routes
- **Route State**: Passing data between routes (room selection)
- **404 Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid routes
- **History Management**: Proper back/forward button behavior

## 6. Key Design and Implementation Decisions

### Architecture Decisions:

#### 1. Component Organization:
- **Modular Structure**: Separate components for reusability
- **Page-Level Components**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Shared Components**: Reusable UI elements (Header, Footer, RoomCard)
- **Service Layer**: Abstracted API calls for maintainability

#### 2. State Management:
- **React Context**: Authentication state management
- **Local State**: Component-specific state with useState
- **Props Drilling**: Minimal due to good component structure
- **State Lifting**: Shared state moved to appropriate parent components

#### 3. Styling Approach:
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first approach for rapid development
- **Component Styles**: Scoped CSS for specific components
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with systematic breakpoints
- **Design System**: Consistent spacing (8px grid) and color palette

#### 4. Data Management:
- **Mock Data**: Development-ready with realistic hotel data
- **API-Ready Services**: Complete service layer for backend integration
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces (types.txt)
- **Data Validation**: Client-side validation with server-ready structure

### Performance Optimizations:
- **Code Splitting**: Route-based code splitting potential
- **Image Optimization**: Responsive images with proper sizing
- **Lazy Loading**: Prepared for image lazy loading implementation
- **Memoization**: Strategic use of React optimization hooks

### User Experience Enhancements:
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
